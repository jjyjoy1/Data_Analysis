#I used to use mothur software to process gene size sequences analysis
#The mothur software is one of metagenomics software, which provide powerful functions to process nt and aa sequences analysis


$module load mothur/1.48.0

#Covid-19 sequences was download from GISAID.
#As example for 05232022 data
#Due to the header of sequence contains a space, mothur will read header mistake, so bash script to replace space to underdash. 
cat spikenuc0523.fasta | sed -e 's/ /_/g' > spikenuc0523.nsp.fasta

#Basic statistical sequences information
summary.seqs(fasta=spikenuc0523.nsp.fasta)

#Remove sequences with too many N, the length of spike is about 3822 nt. So I set maxn is 400(10%) 
screen.seqs(fasta=spikenuc0523.nsp.fasta, maxn=400, start=1, end=3822)

#Remove duplicated sequences
unique.seqs(fasta=spikenuc0523.nsp.good.fasta)

#Because the file is alinment sequences, so either chop all sequences to same length, or add N to the end of sequences file
chop.seqs(fasta=spikeenuc0523.nsp.good.unique.fasta)

#so the final sequences would be:
#spikeenuc0523.nsp.good.unique.fasta


#However, duee to too many good quility Covid-19 sequences, the clustering the globe Covid sequence pipeline failed to build distance distance.
